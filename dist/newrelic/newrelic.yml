  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
  # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
  # account. For example, if your license key is 12345 use this:
  # license_key: '12345'
  # The key binds your Agent's data to your account in the New Relic service.
  # license_key: 'your license key'

  # Set the name of your application as you'd like it show up in New Relic.
  # If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application.
  # Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications)
  # to this application. To report data to more than one application 
  # (useful for rollup reporting), separate the application names with ";".
  # For example, to report data to "My Application" and "My Application 2" use this:
  # app_name: My Application;My Application 2
  # This setting is required. Up to 3 different application names can be specified.
  # The first application name must be unique.
  app_name: BridgePF

  # Set to true to enable support for auto app naming.
  # The name of each web app is detected automatically
  # and the agent reports data separately for each one.
  # This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for
  # web apps in New Relic.
  # Default is false.
  enable_auto_app_naming: true

  # Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming.
  # Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction.
  # Default is true.
  enable_auto_transaction_naming: true

  # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging
  # separate from that of your application.  Specify the log level here.
  # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application.
  # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are:
  #   off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest
  # Default is info.
  log_level: info
